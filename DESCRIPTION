Description: The citizens of Marawi have a right to the data and maps about 
    their home city. When problems are complex, helping people find useful maps 
    (access) can aid them both in finding themselves in the map (understanding) 
    and making the map by themselves (ownership). Open data and useful maps can 
    help empower citizens in mapmaking, placemaking, and decision-making 
    because it can help citizens and interested parties in understanding the 
    issues spatially. It is practical in deliberating, deciding, and delivering 
    the rehabilitation of Marawi City.
