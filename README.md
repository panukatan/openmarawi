> ## Why Open Marawi?

> The citizens of Marawi have a right to the data and maps about their
> home city. When problems are complex, helping people find useful maps
> (access) can aid them both in finding themselves in the map
> (understanding) and making the map by themselves (ownership).

> Open data and useful maps can help empower citizens in mapmaking,
> placemaking, and decision-making because it can help citizens and
> interested parties in understanding the issues spatially. It is
> practical in deliberating, deciding, and delivering the rehabilitation
> of Marawi City.

The `openmarawi` R package supports this effort by providing an
application programming interface to the [Open Marawi shared Google
Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bph1LBRpxwydAvjuggyjmhmq6HhyteY8).
Consistent with the principles of Open Marawi, the `openmarawi` R
package is built and distributed open source on a platform that allows
and encourages community contribution using a programming language that
is also open and freely available to use.

We believe that through this added layer of interface to the Open Marawi
datasets, a cadre of users and developers - including those from Marawi
itself - can support the process of mapmaking, placemaking, and
decision-making that the Open Marawi effort has initiated and continue
to encourage.

## What does `openmarawi` do?

Please note that `openmarawi` is still highly experimental and is
undergoing a lot of development. Hence, any functionalities described
below and in the rest of the package documentation have a high
likelihood of changing interface or approach as we aim for a stable
working version.

Currently, the package provides functions for retrieving Google Drive
specific drive information for main Open Marawi Google Drive and its
sub-directories.

## Installation

`openmarawi` is not yet on CRAN but can be installed from the [panukatan
R universe](https://panukatan.r-universe.dev) as follows:

``` r
install.packages(
  "openmarawi",
  repos = c('https://panukatan.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```
