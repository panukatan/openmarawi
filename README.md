The citizens of Marawi have a right to the data and maps about their
home city. When problems are complex, helping people find useful maps
(access) can aid them both in finding themselves in the map
(understanding) and making the map by themselves (ownership).

Open data and useful maps can help empower citizens in mapmaking,
placemaking, and decision-making because it can help citizens and
interested parties in understanding the issues spatially. It is
practical in deliberating, deciding, and delivering the rehabilitation
of Marawi City.
